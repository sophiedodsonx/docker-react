Created a workflow that uses Docker to author and publish applications, GitHub to deploy code into TravisCI and integrated with AWS Elastic Beanstalk to host the website

Using node.js as a testing container 

Nginx used to produce a production container 

Github used to deploy code into Travis CI and AWS

Travis CI pipeline - set up to watch GitHub for changes and reports back that everything worked successfully

Using AWS Elastic Beanstalk to host the website

Granted permissions to TravisCI to access Beanstalk through AWS IAM
